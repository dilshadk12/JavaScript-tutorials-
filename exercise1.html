    <h1>Exercise 1</h1>

    <!-- Question: 
    Write a JS Progeam to generate a random number and store it in a 
    variable.The program then takes an input from the user to tell 
    them whether the guess was correct,greater or lesser than the 
    original number.100 - (no. of guesses) is the score of the user. 
    The program is expected to terminate once the number is guessed. 
    Number should be between 1 - 100. -->

    <script>
        let a = Math.random() * 100;
        a = Number.parseInt(a);
        let inpt;
        let score = 100;

        while (inpt != a) {
            score = score - 1;
            inpt = prompt("Enter the Number: ");
            if (inpt == a) {
                console.log("Congratulation you have entered the correct Number. ");
                console.log("You guessed the actual number in ", (100 - score), " chances");
            }
            else if (inpt > a && inpt < 100) {
                console.log("Number is greater than the actual number");
            }
            else if (inpt < a && inpt > 0) {
                console.log("Number is smaller than the actual number");
            }
            else {
                console.log("Please Enter Number between 1 to 100");
            }
